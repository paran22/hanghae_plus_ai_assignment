      "instruction": "How do I use 'would have' and 'could have' correctly?",
      "response": "Both 'would have' and 'could have' are used to talk about hypothetical past situations. 'Would have' expresses what you intended to do or what would have happened in a different situation. For example: 'I would have called you, but I lost my phone.' 'Could have' expresses possibility or ability in the past. For example: 'She could have won the race if she had trained harder.' Remember that both are followed by the past participle form of the verb."

      "instruction": "What's the difference between 'affect' and 'effect'?",
      "response": "These words are commonly confused. 'Affect' is usually a verb meaning 'to influence' or 'to cause a change in.' For example: 'The weather affects my mood.' 'Effect' is usually a noun meaning 'a result' or 'an outcome.' For example: 'The effect of the medicine was immediate.' There are exceptions where 'effect' can be a verb meaning 'to bring about' and 'affect' can be a noun referring to emotional expression, but these uses are less common."

      "instruction": "How do I improve my English pronunciation?",
      "response": "Improving English pronunciation takes practice. Here are effective strategies: 1) Listen carefully to native speakers through podcasts, movies, or conversation partners. 2) Record yourself speaking and compare with native pronunciation. 3) Practice minimal pairs (words that differ by just one sound) like 'ship' vs. 'sheep'. 4) Learn the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to understand exact sounds. 5) Focus on stress and intonation patterns, which are crucial for natural-sounding English. 6) Use pronunciation apps or websites that provide feedback. Consistent daily practice, even for just 15 minutes, will lead to significant improvement over time."

    {
      "instruction": "Can you explain when to use 'a', 'an', and 'the'?",
      "response": "These are articles in English. 'A' and 'an' are indefinite articles used before singular nouns when referring to something for the first time or something non-specific. Use 'a' before consonant sounds ('a book', 'a university' - 'university' starts with a consonant sound /y/). Use 'an' before vowel sounds ('an apple', 'an hour' - 'hour' starts with a vowel sound). 'The' is the definite article, used when referring to something specific that both the speaker and listener know about, unique things, or things mentioned previously. For example: 'I saw a dog (first mention). The dog was brown (now specific).'"

      "instruction": "What's the best way to expand my English vocabulary?",
      "response": "To expand your English vocabulary effectively: 1) Read widely across different genres and topics. 2) Learn words in context rather than isolated lists. 3) Use spaced repetition to review new words. 4) Create word families by learning related forms (happy, happiness, unhappy). 5) Study collocations (words that naturally go together like 'heavy rain' or 'make a decision'). 6) Use new words in your speaking and writing. 7) Keep a vocabulary journal. 8) Learn prefixes and suffixes to understand word formation. 9) Use English-language media daily. 10) Try word games and puzzles. Consistency is key - aim to learn a small number of words thoroughly rather than many words superficially."

    {
      "instruction": "When do I use Present Perfect vs. Past Simple tense?",
      "response": "Present Perfect (have/has + past participle) connects the past to the present. Use it for: 1) Actions that started in the past and continue to the present ('I have lived here for 5 years' - still living here). 2) Past experiences with present relevance but no specific time ('I have visited Paris' - sometime in my life). 3) Recently completed actions ('I have just finished my homework'). Past Simple (verb + ed/irregular form) is for completed actions at a specific time in the past. Use it when: 1) The action is finished ('I lived in London for 5 years' - not living there now). 2) There's a specific time reference ('I visited Paris last summer'). 3) For sequences of completed actions ('I woke up, ate breakfast, and went to work')."

      "instruction": "How can I write better emails in English?",
      "response": "For professional English emails: 1) Use clear subject lines that summarize the purpose. 2) Begin with an appropriate greeting ('Dear Mr./Ms./Dr. [Last name]' for formal emails; 'Hi [First name]' for less formal contexts). 3) Be concise and organize content in short paragraphs. 4) Use proper transitions between ideas. 5) Maintain a professional tone - avoid slang, contractions, and exclamation marks in formal emails. 6) Close appropriately ('Sincerely,' 'Best regards,' for formal; 'Best,' 'Thanks,' for casual). 7) Proofread for grammar, spelling, and punctuation. 8) If making a request, be polite and clear about what you need and by when. 9) For important emails, have someone review before sending if possible."

    {
      "instruction": "What are phrasal verbs and how do I learn them?",
      "response": "Phrasal verbs are combinations of verbs and particles (prepositions or adverbs) that create meanings different from the original verb alone. For example, 'look up' means to search for information, not just to look upward. These are challenging because they're often idiomatic. To learn them effectively: 1) Study them in context through authentic materials like books, TV shows, and conversations. 2) Group them by common verbs (get up, get on, get over) or by themes (phrasal verbs related to business). 3) Note whether they're separable (where an object can come between the verb and particle) or inseparable. 4) Practice using them in your own sentences. 5) Learn them gradually, focusing on the most common ones first. 6) Use spaced repetition to review them regularly."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "Can you help me understand the conditional tenses in English?",
      "response": "English has four main conditional structures: Zero Conditional (If + present simple, present simple): Expresses general truths or scientific facts. 'If you heat water to 100°C, it boils.' First Conditional (If + present simple, will + base form): For possible future situations and their likely results. 'If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home.' Second Conditional (If + past simple, would + base form): For hypothetical or unlikely present/future situations. 'If I won the lottery, I would travel the world.' Third Conditional (If + past perfect, would have + past participle): For hypothetical situations in the past that didn't happen. 'If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.' Mixed conditionals combine different times. 'If I had saved money (past), I would be rich now (present).'"

      "instruction": "How do I use commas correctly in English?",
      "response": "Commas have several important uses in English: 1) In lists: 'I bought apples, oranges, and bananas.' (The comma before 'and' is called the Oxford comma and is optional but recommended for clarity). 2) With coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS: for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) joining independent clauses: 'I wanted to go out, but it was raining.' 3) After introductory elements: 'After the movie, we went for dinner.' 4) Around non-essential information: 'My brother, who lives in London, is visiting next week.' 5) With direct address: 'Thank you, John, for your help.' 6) In dates and addresses: 'July 4, 1776' and 'Chicago, Illinois, USA.' 7) To separate adjectives of equal rank: 'It was a long, tiring day.' Avoid comma splices (incorrectly joining two independent clauses with only a comma)."

      "instruction": "What's the best approach to learn English idioms?",
      "response": "To master English idioms: 1) Learn them in context through movies, TV shows, books, and conversations rather than memorizing lists. 2) Group idioms by themes (business, emotions, time) or common words ('heart,' 'hand,' 'time'). 3) Understand the literal meaning first, then the figurative meaning, and the origins if helpful. 4) Create mental images to connect with their meanings. 5) Use spaced repetition to review regularly. 6) Practice using them in your own sentences and conversations. 7) Start with the most common idioms first. 8) Note the formality level and appropriate contexts. 9) Be careful with idioms in formal writing or international business contexts where they might not be understood. Some common examples include 'break the ice' (reduce tension in social situations), 'cost an arm and a leg' (very expensive), and 'hit the books' (study hard)."

      "instruction": "How do I improve my English listening skills?",
      "response": "To improve English listening: 1) Start with materials slightly above your level for optimal challenge. 2) Use varied resources: podcasts, TED talks, audiobooks, movies, TV shows, YouTube videos, and news broadcasts. 3) Listen actively by predicting content, focusing on main ideas first, then details. 4) Use transcripts or subtitles initially, then gradually remove them. 5) Practice 'micro-listening' by replaying short segments until you understand completely. 6) Take notes while listening to stay engaged. 7) Listen to different accents and speech rates. 8) Combine listening with other activities (shadowing, summarizing, answering questions). 9) Create a daily routine - even 15 minutes consistently is effective. 10) Use apps designed for listening practice that match your interests. Regular exposure to natural spoken English is key to improvement."

      "instruction": "What are some common English writing mistakes to avoid?",
      "response": "Common English writing mistakes to avoid: 1) Run-on sentences or comma splices - joining independent clauses without proper punctuation or conjunctions. 2) Subject-verb agreement errors, especially with confusing subjects like 'each,' 'everyone,' or collective nouns. 3) Inconsistent verb tenses within paragraphs. 4) Dangling modifiers that don't clearly relate to what they're supposed to modify. 5) Overuse of passive voice when active would be clearer. 6) Vague pronoun references where 'it,' 'this,' or 'that' don't clearly refer to a specific noun. 7) Wordiness - using many words when fewer would be clearer. 8) Incorrect punctuation with quotations or apostrophes. 9) Incorrect word choices like affect/effect or their/they're/there. 10) Inconsistent formatting of lists, headings, or citations. Regular proofreading, using style guides, and getting feedback from others can help identify and fix these common issues."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "How do I form and use the passive voice correctly?",
      "response": "The passive voice structure is: subject + appropriate form of 'be' + past participle (+ by + agent - optional). Example: 'The letter was written by John' versus active 'John wrote the letter.' Use passive voice when: 1) The agent (doer) is unknown, unimportant, or obvious: 'My car was stolen' (unknown thief). 2) You want to emphasize the recipient of the action: 'The award was given to Jane' (emphasizing Jane). 3) In scientific or academic writing to sound objective: 'The experiment was conducted' instead of 'We conducted the experiment.' 4) To be diplomatic or avoid blame: 'Mistakes were made' instead of 'You made mistakes.' Passive can be formed in any tense: Present: 'The house is cleaned weekly.' Past: 'The house was cleaned yesterday.' Future: 'The house will be cleaned tomorrow.' Present perfect: 'The house has been cleaned.' Be careful not to overuse passive voice as it can make writing wordier and less direct."
    },
    {
      "instruction": "What's the difference between 'few/a few' and 'little/a little'?",
      "response": "These pairs express similar concepts but with different nouns: 'Few/a few' are used with countable nouns (things you can count individually): 'Few people came to the party' (negative - emphasizing the small number, suggesting 'almost none'). 'A few people came to the party' (positive - emphasizing that some came, even if not many). 'Little/a little' are used with uncountable nouns (things you can't count individually): 'There is little hope of success' (negative - emphasizing the lack, suggesting 'almost no hope'). 'There is a little hope of success' (positive - emphasizing that some hope exists). The addition of 'a' changes the meaning significantly, shifting from a negative emphasis on scarcity to a more positive emphasis on the existence of some amount, however small."

      "instruction": "How can I improve my English speaking fluency?",
      "response": "To improve English speaking fluency: 1) Practice regularly - even 10-15 minutes daily is better than occasional longer sessions. 2) Find conversation partners through language exchanges, online platforms, or speaking clubs. 3) Talk to yourself in English when alone, describing your day or surroundings. 4) Read aloud to improve pronunciation and rhythm without the pressure of generating content. 5) Try shadowing - repeating what you hear immediately after a native speaker. 6) Record yourself speaking and listen critically. 7) Learn common phrases and expressions rather than isolated words. 8) Prepare for predictable conversations like ordering food or asking directions. 9) Don't focus on perfection - fluency comes from practice despite mistakes. 10) Build vocabulary in topics you frequently discuss. 11) Use fillers ('well,' 'you know,' 'actually') appropriately to avoid silence while thinking. 12) Exposure to varied accents and speech patterns will improve comprehension skills that support fluency."

      "instruction": "What are the different ways to say 'very' in English?",
      "response": "Instead of repeatedly using 'very,' try these alternatives for more precise and expressive English: For very happy: delighted, ecstatic, thrilled, overjoyed. For very sad: devastated, heartbroken, despondent, miserable. For very tired: exhausted, drained, worn out, fatigued. For very angry: furious, enraged, livid, infuriated. For very big: enormous, massive, gigantic, colossal. For very small: tiny, minuscule, microscopic, diminutive. For very good: excellent, outstanding, exceptional, superb. For very bad: terrible, dreadful, awful, atrocious. For very important: crucial, essential, vital, critical. For very beautiful: gorgeous, stunning, exquisite, magnificent. Using these specific intensifiers not only makes your English more interesting but also conveys more precise meanings and emotions than the generic 'very.'"

      "instruction": "What are the rules for subject-verb agreement in English?",
      "response": "Basic subject-verb agreement rules: 1) Singular subjects take singular verbs: 'He writes well.' 2) Plural subjects take plural verbs: 'They write well.' Special cases: 3) Compound subjects joined by 'and' typically take plural verbs: 'Tom and Maria are here.' 4) When subjects are joined by 'or/nor,' the verb agrees with the closest subject: 'Neither the students nor the teacher knows the answer.' 5) Collective nouns (team, family, committee) can take singular or plural verbs depending on whether you're emphasizing the group as a unit or individual members: 'The team is winning' (as a unit) vs. 'The team are arguing among themselves' (as individuals). 6) 'Each,' 'everyone,' 'everybody,' 'anyone,' 'nobody,' 'somebody' take singular verbs: 'Everyone has arrived.' 7) Some nouns ending in 's' are singular: news, mathematics, physics. 8) When 'there' or 'here' begins a sentence, the verb agrees with the subject following it: 'There are many questions' vs. 'There is one question.'"

      "response": "Use 'in' for: 1) Months: in January, in February. 2) Seasons: in summer, in winter. 3) Years: in 2023. 4) Parts of the day: in the morning, in the afternoon, in the evening (but 'at night'). 5) After a period of time: in an hour, in a week. 6) Centuries: in the 21st century. Use 'on' for: 1) Days of the week: on Monday, on Tuesday. 2) Dates: on April 15, on Christmas Day. 3) Specific day + part of day: on Friday morning. 4) Special days: on my birthday, on Independence Day. Use 'at' for: 1) Specific times: at 3 o'clock, at 10:30. 2) Night: at night. 3) Meal times: at breakfast, at lunch. 4) Holiday periods: at Christmas, at Easter (when referring to the general period rather than the specific day). 5) Weekend: at the weekend (British English) vs. on the weekend (American English). Remember: we arrive 'in' a country, 'at' a specific place, and 'on' a street."

      "instruction": "What are modal verbs and how do I use them?",
      "response": "Modal verbs (can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must) express necessity, possibility, permission, ability, or obligation. Key characteristics: 1) They don't change form for different subjects (no -s in third person singular). 2) They're followed by the base form of the verb without 'to.' 3) They don't have infinitive or -ing forms. Common uses: 'Can/Could' - ability, possibility, permission ('I can swim,' 'Could you help me?'). 'May/Might' - possibility, permission ('It may rain,' 'May I come in?'). 'Will/Would' - future actions, requests, habits ('I will call you,' 'Would you mind opening the window?'). 'Shall/Should' - suggestions, obligations, expectations ('Shall we go?', 'You should study more'). 'Must' - strong obligation, logical conclusion ('You must follow the rules,' 'He's not here; he must be sick'). Semi-modals like 'have to,' 'need to,' and 'ought to' function similarly but can change form and be used in all tenses."

      "instruction": "How do I make polite requests in English?",
      "response": "For polite requests in English, using the right structure signals respect and consideration: 1) Use modal verbs like 'could,' 'would,' or 'may' instead of 'can': 'Could you help me with this?' is more polite than 'Can you help me with this?' 2) Add 'please': 'Would you please send me the report?' 3) Use 'I was wondering if' for very polite requests: 'I was wondering if you could possibly give me a ride.' 4) Try indirect questions: 'Do you know if this seat is taken?' instead of 'Is this seat taken?' 5) Use past tense forms for increased politeness: 'I wanted to ask you something' sounds softer than 'I want to ask you something.' 6) Add softeners like 'possibly,' 'perhaps,' or 'maybe': 'Could you perhaps help me with this?' 7) Use question forms instead of imperatives: 'Would you mind closing the window?' instead of 'Close the window.' 8) Express appreciation in advance: 'I'd be very grateful if you could...' The more formal the situation or the bigger the request, the more polite forms you should use."

      "instruction": "What are reporting verbs and how do I use them?",
      "response": "Reporting verbs are used to report what someone said, thought, or felt. They add nuance beyond the basic 'say' and 'tell.' Common reporting verbs and their patterns: 1) Verb + that-clause: claim, explain, suggest, think, believe, assume ('She explained that she was delayed by traffic'). 2) Verb + to-infinitive: agree, decide, offer, promise, threaten ('He promised to call me'). 3) Verb + object + to-infinitive: advise, encourage, invite, remind, warn ('They advised me to arrive early'). 4) Verb + -ing form: admit, deny, recommend, suggest ('He admitted stealing the money'). 5) Verb + preposition + -ing form: apologize for, insist on, think about ('She apologized for arriving late'). Different reporting verbs convey different attitudes toward what was said: 'admit' suggests accepting guilt, 'claim' suggests doubt about truth, 'explain' is neutral. In formal academic writing, choose reporting verbs carefully to show your stance toward cited sources: 'demonstrates' shows strong agreement, while 'suggests' shows more reservation."

    {
      "instruction": "What's the difference between 'good' and 'well'?",
      "response": "'Good' is primarily an adjective used to describe nouns: 'She is a good singer.' 'The food tastes good.' 'He has good manners.' 'Good' answers the question 'what kind?' about a noun. 'Well' is primarily an adverb used to modify verbs, describing how an action is performed: 'She sings well.' 'He speaks English well.' 'The project was well managed.' 'Well' answers the question 'how?' about an action. Exception: With linking verbs related to health or feeling (feel, look, seem), either can be used with slightly different meanings: 'I feel good' (describes your emotional state or general wellbeing). 'I feel well' (typically refers specifically to physical health). Common mistake to avoid: 'I did good on the test' should be 'I did well on the test' because 'did' is a verb and needs an adverb to modify it."

If you don't know the recipient's name, use 'Dear Sir/Madam:' or 'To Whom It May Concern:'. 4) Subject line (optional): 'Subject: Job Application for [Position]' or 'Re: Your Inquiry of May 15.' 5) Introduction stating your purpose clearly and concisely. 6) Body paragraphs developing your main points logically with clear topic sentences. 7) Conclusion summarizing your purpose and indicating any expected action. 8) Formal closing: 'Yours sincerely,' (when you know the recipient's name) or 'Yours faithfully,' (when addressed to Sir/Madam). 9) Your signature. 10) Your typed name and title below. Style should be concise, clear, and formal: avoid contractions, slang, and casual expressions; use passive voice where appropriate; maintain a professional, respectful tone throughout; and proofread carefully before sending."

      "instruction": "Can you explain count and non-count nouns in English?",
      "response": "Count nouns refer to things that can be counted individually: books, cars, ideas, people. They have singular and plural forms ('one book, two books'). Non-count (or mass) nouns refer to things that cannot be counted as separate items: water, rice, furniture, information. They typically don't have plural forms and use singular verbs. Key differences: 1) Articles: Count nouns can use 'a/an' in singular form ('a car'), non-count nouns cannot ('water,' not 'a water'). 2) Quantifiers: Use 'many' and 'few' with count nouns ('many books'), 'much' and 'little' with non-count nouns ('much information'). 'Some,' 'a lot of,' and 'plenty of' work with both. 3) Specific quantities: Count nouns work directly with numbers ('three chairs'), while non-count nouns need unit expressions ('three pieces of furniture'). Some nouns can be both: 'coffee' (non-count: 'I drink coffee every morning') vs. 'coffees' (count: 'We ordered three coffees'). Some typically non-count nouns can be count when referring to types or varieties: 'The restaurant serves many wines from Italy.'"

      "instruction": "How do I use apostrophes correctly in English?",
      "response": "Apostrophes have two main uses: 1) Showing possession: For singular nouns, add 's: 'the girl's book,' 'James's car' (or 'James' car' - both acceptable). For regular plural nouns ending in s, add only an apostrophe: 'the girls' books,' 'the Joneses' house.' For irregular plurals not ending in s, add 's: 'children's toys,' 'people's opinions.' For compound nouns, add 's to the final word: 'my brother-in-law's house.' For joint ownership, add 's to the last name only: 'Jack and Jill's pail.' For separate ownership, add 's to both: 'Jack's and Jill's opinions.' 2) Contractions - showing where letters are omitted: 'don't' (do not), 'I'm' (I am), 'we'll' (we will), 'they're' (they are), 'it's' (it is or it has). Common mistakes to avoid: Using apostrophes for simple plurals ('apple's for sale' should be 'apples for sale'); confusing 'its' (possessive) with 'it's' (contraction of 'it is' or 'it has'); confusing 'your' (possessive) with 'you're' (contraction of 'you are')."

      "instruction": "What's the difference between 'bring' and 'take'?",
      "response": "The difference between 'bring' and 'take' is about direction relative to the speaker or reference point: 'Bring' indicates movement toward the speaker or reference point: 'Please bring your report to my office' (the speaker is at the office). 'Can you bring dessert to the party?' (the speaker will be at the party). 'Take' indicates movement away from the speaker or reference point: 'Please take these documents to the accounting department' (the speaker is not going to accounting). 'I'll take a gift when I visit them tomorrow' (the speaker is moving away with the gift). In reported speech or when the reference point changes, the choice can be trickier: 'She asked if I could bring a bottle of wine' (toward her). 'She asked if I could take a bottle of wine' (away from where we were talking, to a third location). When in doubt, visualize the direction of movement - toward or away from the speaker or focal point of the conversation."

'Effect' is most often used as a noun meaning 'a result' or 'an outcome,' as in 'The effect of the medicine was immediate.'

      "response": "The present continuous tense (also called present progressive) is used to talk about actions happening now or temporary situations. It's formed using the present tense of the verb 'to be' (am/is/are) + the -ing form of the main verb. For example: 'I am reading a book,' 'She is studying English,' 'They are playing football.' We use this tense for actions happening at the moment of speaking, temporary situations ('I'm staying with friends until I find an apartment'), planned future arrangements ('I'm meeting John tomorrow'), and to describe trends ('The global temperature is rising'). Remember that some verbs (state verbs) typically aren't used in continuous forms, such as like, love, believe, understand, and know."

      "instruction": "Explain the difference between 'few', 'a few', 'little', and 'a little'.",
      "response": "'Few', 'a few', 'little', and 'a little' are quantifiers in English that can be tricky to use correctly. 'Few' and 'little' have a negative meaning, suggesting 'not many/much' or 'almost none.' 'Few' is used with countable nouns: 'Few people attended the meeting' (suggesting poor attendance). 'Little' is used with uncountable nouns: 'There is little hope of finding survivors' (suggesting the situation is bleak). Adding 'a' changes the meaning to something positive. 'A few' means 'some' with countable nouns: 'A few friends came to help' (suggesting a small but sufficient number). 'A little' means 'some' with uncountable nouns: 'I have a little money saved' (suggesting a small but useful amount). Remember: 'few/a few' for things you can count, 'little/a little' for things you cannot count."

      "instruction": "What's the proper way to write a formal email in English?",
      "response": "A formal email in English follows a clear structure. Begin with an appropriate greeting like 'Dear Mr./Ms./Dr. [Last Name],' or 'Dear Sir/Madam,' if you don't know the recipient's name. In the opening paragraph, introduce yourself if necessary and state your purpose clearly and concisely. The body paragraphs should contain the main message, with each paragraph focusing on one main point. Keep sentences relatively short and use formal vocabulary, avoiding contractions, slang, and abbreviations. For the closing paragraph, include any necessary action items, express gratitude, and mention your availability for further discussion. End with a formal closing such as 'Yours sincerely,' (when you know the recipient's name) or 'Yours faithfully,' (when you don't), followed by your full name and contact information. Ensure your email is properly formatted with spaces between paragraphs, proofread for errors, and has a clear, specific subject line."

      "instruction": "How do I use articles (a, an, the) correctly in English?",
      "response": "Using articles correctly in English requires understanding three basic rules: 1) Use 'a' before consonant sounds ('a book', 'a university' - despite starting with a vowel, 'university' begins with a consonant sound /j/). 2) Use 'an' before vowel sounds ('an apple', 'an hour' - despite starting with a consonant, 'hour' begins with a vowel sound). 3) Use 'the' for specific nouns the listener/reader knows about ('I bought a book. The book was interesting.'), unique things ('the sun', 'the president'), and with superlatives ('the best'). Don't use articles with most plural or uncountable nouns when making general statements ('Dogs are loyal', not 'The dogs are loyal'), most names of countries, cities, streets (except when they include common nouns like 'the United States'), and abstract concepts ('Love is important', not 'The love is important'). Remember that article usage varies with idiomatic expressions and can differ between American and British English."

      "instruction": "What are phrasal verbs and how do I use them?",
      "response": "Phrasal verbs are combinations of verbs and prepositions or adverbs that create meanings different from the original verb. For example, 'look up' means to search for information, not literally to look upward. Phrasal verbs are common in everyday English and make your speech sound more natural. There are three types: 1) Intransitive phrasal verbs don't take an object ('The plane took off'). 2) Separable phrasal verbs allow the object to come between the verb and particle ('Turn the light off' or 'Turn off the light'). 3) Inseparable phrasal verbs must keep the verb and particle together ('I'm looking forward to the weekend'). To learn phrasal verbs effectively, study them in context rather than memorizing lists, use them in real conversations, group them by common verbs (get, take, put), and pay attention to their usage in movies, songs, and books. Be aware that many phrasal verbs have multiple meanings depending on context."

      "instruction": "Can you explain when to use past simple vs. present perfect tenses?",
      "response": "The past simple and present perfect tenses express different relationships with time. Use past simple (I worked, she ate) for completed actions at a specific time in the past ('I visited Paris last summer'), regular past habits ('He played tennis every Sunday'), or sequential past events ('She woke up, got dressed, and left'). The past simple always needs a specific time reference, stated or implied. Use present perfect (I have worked, she has eaten) for past experiences with no specific time ('I have visited Paris' - sometime in my life), actions that started in the past and continue to the present ('I have lived here for ten years'), recent past actions with current relevance ('I have just finished my homework'), and actions occurring in an incomplete time period ('I have seen three movies this week' - and the week isn't over). Remember that time expressions like 'yesterday,' 'last week,' and 'in 2010' require past simple, while expressions like 'ever,' 'never,' 'just,' 'already,' 'yet,' 'since,' and 'for' often signal present perfect."

      "instruction": "What's the difference between 'say', 'tell', 'speak', and 'talk'?",
      "response": "The verbs 'say', 'tell', 'speak', and 'talk' all relate to verbal communication but are used differently. 'Say' focuses on the words themselves and is usually followed by a direct quote or 'that' clause: 'He said, \"I'm tired\"' or 'She said that she would come.' It doesn't require an indirect object. 'Tell' focuses on conveying information to someone and requires an indirect object (the person being told): 'She told me about her trip' or 'He told the truth.' 'Speak' refers to the act of producing language or giving a formal address: 'She speaks Japanese fluently' or 'The president will speak at the conference.' It can be followed by 'to' when indicating the recipient: 'I need to speak to your manager.' 'Talk' emphasizes the exchange of ideas or conversation: 'We talked about the project for hours' or 'She's talking with her friend.' 'Talk' is often followed by 'about' (the topic) or 'to/with' (the conversation partner). Remember these fixed expressions: 'tell a story/joke/lie', 'tell the truth/time', 'give a talk', 'make a speech', 'have a talk/conversation', 'say a prayer/word'."

      "instruction": "How do I improve my English pronunciation?",
      "response": "Improving English pronunciation requires consistent practice and awareness. First, focus on sounds that don't exist in your native language, as these will be the most challenging. Use online resources or apps that show mouth positions for different sounds. Listen carefully to native speakers through podcasts, movies, or language exchange partners, and practice mimicking them. Record yourself speaking and compare it to native pronunciation. Learn and practice minimal pairs (words that differ by just one sound, like 'ship' and 'sheep'). Pay attention to word stress, sentence stress, and intonation patterns, which are crucial for natural-sounding English. Practice linking words together as native speakers do, rather than pronouncing each word separately. Don't rush—speaking more slowly but correctly is better than speaking quickly with poor pronunciation. Consider working with a pronunciation coach or taking a specialized course for personalized feedback. Finally, remember that clear communication is more important than eliminating your accent completely."

      "instruction": "What are the different ways to express future tense in English?",
      "response": "English has several ways to express the future, each with specific uses. 1) Will + base verb ('I will call you tomorrow') is used for predictions, promises, spontaneous decisions, and offers. 2) Going to + base verb ('I'm going to visit my parents') expresses planned future actions or predictions based on present evidence. 3) Present continuous ('I'm meeting John at 5') indicates arranged future plans, especially with a time reference. 4) Present simple ('The train leaves at 8') is used for scheduled events like timetables. 5) Future continuous (will be + -ing: 'I'll be working at 8') describes actions that will be in progress at a future time. 6) Future perfect (will have + past participle: 'I will have finished by noon') describes actions that will be completed before a future time. 7) Future perfect continuous (will have been + -ing: 'I will have been working for 10 hours') emphasizes the duration of an action up to a future point. Choose the appropriate form based on how certain, planned, or formal the future action is."

      "instruction": "What are some common English idioms about business and work?",
      "response": "English business communication often includes idioms that can be confusing for non-native speakers. Here are some common work-related idioms: 'Break even' means to neither make profit nor lose money. 'Think outside the box' encourages creative, unconventional thinking. 'Get the ball rolling' means to start a project or process. 'Call it a day' suggests finishing work for the day. 'Back to the drawing board' means starting over after a failed attempt. 'Cut corners' refers to doing something quickly but not thoroughly. 'Pull your weight' means to do your fair share of work. 'Bring something to the table' refers to contributing valuable skills or ideas. 'The bottom line' refers to the final, most important factor (originally the final line in financial statements showing profit/loss). 'Hit the ground running' means to start a new job or project with immediate efficiency. 'In the loop' means being informed about something. 'Raise the bar' means to set higher standards. 'Learning curve' refers to the time needed to learn a new skill. Using these idioms appropriately can make your business English sound more natural and professional."

      "instruction": "How do I politely disagree with someone in English?",
      "response": "Politely disagreeing in English requires using appropriate language and tone to respect the other person's perspective while expressing your own. Start with acknowledgment phrases that validate their point: 'I see what you're saying, but...', 'I understand your perspective, however...', or 'You make a good point, though I think...' Use softening expressions to make your disagreement less direct: 'I'm not entirely convinced that...', 'I tend to think differently because...', or 'I'm not sure I agree with that assessment.' Frame your disagreement as a personal view rather than an absolute truth: 'In my experience...', 'From my perspective...', or 'The way I see it...' Ask questions to explore different angles: 'Have you considered...?', 'What do you think about...?', or 'Could there be another explanation, such as...?' Use appropriate body language: maintain eye contact, keep a respectful tone, and avoid aggressive gestures. In professional settings, focus on ideas rather than persons: 'This approach might have some limitations...' instead of 'Your approach is wrong.' Remember that cultural contexts affect what's considered polite, so adjust your style based on who you're speaking with."

    {
      "instruction": "How do I use conditionals (if clauses) correctly in English?",
      "response": "English conditionals express hypothetical situations and their consequences. There are four main types: 1) Zero conditional ('If water reaches 100°C, it boils') expresses general truths or scientific facts. Use present simple in both clauses. 2) First conditional ('If it rains tomorrow, I will stay home') discusses possible future situations. Use present simple in the if-clause and will/can/may + base verb in the result clause. 3) Second conditional ('If I won the lottery, I would travel the world') describes unlikely or hypothetical present/future situations. Use past simple in the if-clause and would/could/might + base verb in the result clause. 4) Third conditional ('If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam') refers to impossible past situations. Use past perfect in the if-clause and would/could/might + have + past participle in the result clause. Mixed conditionals combine different types, usually second and third ('If I had saved money [past], I would be rich now [present]'). Remember that 'if' can often be replaced by 'unless' (meaning 'if not'), 'provided that,' 'as long as,' or 'on condition that' with slight changes in meaning. The if-clause can come before or after the main clause, with a comma needed when it comes first."

      "instruction": "What are common mistakes that non-native speakers make in English?",
      "response": "Non-native English speakers often make predictable mistakes that vary somewhat based on their first language. Common errors include: 1) Article usage - omitting necessary articles or adding unnecessary ones ('I bought car' instead of 'I bought a car'). 2) Preposition errors - using incorrect prepositions ('I arrived to the airport' instead of 'I arrived at the airport'). 3) Word order confusion - placing adjectives after nouns or creating overly complex sentences ('Car red' instead of 'red car'). 4) Subject-verb agreement issues - especially with irregular plurals ('The people is happy' instead of 'The people are happy'). 5) Tense inconsistency - shifting inappropriately between past and present ('Yesterday I go to the store and bought food'). 6) Countable/uncountable noun confusion - using plural forms for uncountable nouns ('informations,' 'advices'). 7) False friends - using words that sound similar to words in their native language but have different meanings in English. 8) Phrasal verb avoidance - using formal single-word verbs instead of more natural phrasal verbs. 9) Literal translations from their native language - creating unnatural expressions. 10) Over-formality or over-informality - not adjusting language to the appropriate context. Being aware of these common pitfalls can help you monitor your own speech and writing for improvement."

      "instruction": "How do I make small talk in English?",
      "response": "Making small talk in English involves discussing light topics in a friendly manner to establish rapport. Start with greetings appropriate to the time of day ('Good morning/afternoon/evening') followed by 'How are you?' or 'How's it going?' Safe topics include the weather ('Beautiful day, isn't it?'), compliments ('I like your jacket, where did you get it?'), shared experiences ('This conference is interesting, which sessions have you attended?'), general news (avoid politics), sports, entertainment, food, travel, and weekend plans. Ask open-ended questions that can't be answered with just 'yes' or 'no' to keep the conversation flowing: 'What do you think about...?' or 'How do you feel about...?' Show interest by nodding, maintaining appropriate eye contact, and using follow-up questions ('Really? What happened next?'). Use conversational connectors like 'By the way,' 'Speaking of which,' and 'That reminds me' to transition between topics naturally. Remember cultural differences affect small talk—Americans often discuss work early in conversations, while in some cultures this is considered too personal. Be mindful of body language, maintain a friendly tone, and watch for signs that indicate whether the other person wants to continue talking or end the conversation."

    {
      "instruction": "What's the difference between formal and informal English?",
      "response": "Formal and informal English differ in vocabulary, grammar, sentence structure, and usage contexts. Formal English is used in academic writing, business communications, speeches, and with people you don't know well. It features precise vocabulary (obtain vs. get), complete sentences without contractions (I am vs. I'm), complex grammatical structures, passive voice ('The matter will be investigated'), no phrasal verbs (investigate vs. look into), no slang or colloquialisms, and polite expressions ('Would you mind...?' instead of 'Can you...?'). Informal English is used with friends, family, casual situations, and personal communications. It includes contractions (don't, I'll), simpler vocabulary, phrasal verbs (put off vs. postpone), slang and idioms, incomplete sentences ('Nice to meet you' instead of 'It is nice to meet you'), and direct requests ('Give me that'). The key to effective communication is choosing the appropriate register based on your audience and purpose. In digital communication, emails to professors or employers should use formal English, while texts to friends can be informal. Many situations call for neutral English that falls between these extremes."

      "instruction": "How do I write a good essay in English?",
      "response": "Writing a strong English essay requires planning, clear structure, and careful revision. Begin by understanding the assignment prompt thoroughly. Brainstorm ideas related to your topic, then create an outline with your thesis statement (your main argument) and key supporting points. A standard essay consists of an introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion. The introduction should grab attention, provide background information, and end with your thesis statement. Each body paragraph should focus on one main idea that supports your thesis, starting with a topic sentence, followed by evidence, explanation, and a concluding sentence that links back to your thesis. Use transition words (furthermore, however, consequently) to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs. The conclusion should restate your thesis, summarize main points, and end with a broader statement about the topic's significance. Throughout your essay, use varied sentence structures and precise vocabulary appropriate to your audience. Cite sources correctly using the required format (MLA, APA, etc.). After writing, revise for content and organization first, then edit for grammar, spelling, and punctuation. Read your essay aloud to catch awkward phrasing. Finally, have someone else review it if possible. Remember that good writing is rewriting—quality essays rarely emerge in first drafts."

    {
      "instruction": "How do modal verbs work in English?",
      "response": "Modal verbs in English (can, could, may, might, shall, should, will, would, must, ought to) express possibility, permission, ability, obligation, and other conditions. They function differently from regular verbs: they don't change form for different subjects (no -s for third person singular), are followed by the base form of the main verb without 'to' (except 'ought to'), form questions by inversion without 'do/does/did' ('Can you swim?' not 'Do you can swim?'), and form negatives by adding 'not' directly ('cannot/can't,' 'should not/shouldn't'). Each modal has specific uses: 'Can/could' express ability, possibility, or permission, with 'could' being more polite or referring to past ability. 'May/might' express possibility or permission, with 'might' suggesting less certainty. 'Must' expresses obligation or logical conclusion ('He must be tired'). 'Should/ought to' express advice or expectation. 'Will/would' express future actions, habits, or requests, with 'would' being more polite. 'Shall' (formal) expresses future actions or suggestions. Modal verbs can express different degrees of certainty ('must be' vs. 'might be') and formality ('can' vs. 'may'). For past time reference, use modal + have + past participle ('should have called'). Semi-modals like 'need to,' 'have to,' and 'be able to' function similarly but can change form for tense and subject."

      "instruction": "What are reporting verbs and how do I use them?",
      "response": "Reporting verbs are used to convey what someone has said, thought, or written. They go beyond basic 'say' and 'tell' to express the speaker's attitude or intention. Reporting verbs fall into different patterns: 1) Verb + that-clause: 'She claimed that she was innocent,' 'He suggested that we wait.' 2) Verb + object + that-clause: 'She convinced me that it was true,' 'He reminded her that the meeting was tomorrow.' 3) Verb + to-infinitive: 'She agreed to help,' 'He offered to drive.' 4) Verb + object + to-infinitive: 'She advised me to study,' 'He encouraged her to apply.' 5) Verb + gerund (-ing form): 'He admitted stealing the money,' 'She suggested going earlier.' Common reporting verbs include agree, announce, argue, claim, complain, confirm, deny, explain, insist, mention, promise, recommend, refuse, suggest, and warn. Each carries a specific nuance: 'insist' implies forceful assertion, 'suggest' implies a recommendation, 'admit' implies reluctant acknowledgment. Using varied reporting verbs makes your writing more precise and interesting. When changing from direct to indirect speech with reporting verbs, you often need to adjust pronouns, tense, and time expressions: 'I'll help you tomorrow' → 'She promised to help me the next day.' In academic writing, reporting verbs help you present others' ideas while indicating your stance toward them."

      "instruction": "What's the difference between American and British English?",
      "response": "American and British English differ in several key areas. In spelling, British English often retains letters from original word etymologies that American English drops: 'colour' vs. 'color', 'centre' vs. 'center', 'travelled' vs. 'traveled', 'specialise' vs. 'specialize'. Vocabulary differences include everyday items ('lift' vs. 'elevator', 'flat' vs. 'apartment', 'biscuit' vs. 'cookie') and less obvious terms ('queue' vs. 'line', 'holiday' vs. 'vacation'). Grammatically, collective nouns like 'team' or 'government' take singular verbs in American English ('The team is winning') but can take plural verbs in British English ('The team are playing well'). Americans typically use simple past tense for recent actions ('I just ate') while British speakers may use present perfect ('I've just eaten'). British English often omits 'on' with days ('Monday' vs. 'on Monday'). Prepositions sometimes differ: 'different from' (US) vs. 'different to/from' (UK). In pronunciation, British English generally doesn't pronounce 'r' sounds unless followed by a vowel, whereas American English pronounces all 'r' sounds. Stress patterns can differ too: 'a-DRESS' (UK) vs. 'AD-dress' (US). While these differences exist, globalization and media have blurred the lines, and both varieties are mutually intelligible. Neither is 'correct'—just different standards for different regions."

      "instruction": "How do I improve my English vocabulary?",
      "response": "To build English vocabulary effectively, focus on learning words in context rather than isolated lists. Read widely across different genres and topics, noting unfamiliar words and their context. When you encounter new words, try to guess their meaning before looking them up, then create your own example sentence. Use spaced repetition systems (like Anki) to review words at optimal intervals for memory retention. Group words thematically (foods, emotions, academic terms) or by word families (happy, unhappiness, happily) to create mental connections. Study collocations (words that naturally go together like 'heavy rain' or 'strong coffee') and fixed expressions to sound more natural. Learn prefixes (un-, dis-, re-) and suffixes (-tion, -ment, -able) to understand word formation patterns. Keep a personalized vocabulary notebook organized by topic or situation. Follow the 'use it or lose it' principle by actively using new words in writing and speaking. Set specific goals like learning 5-10 new words daily. Use vocabulary-building apps that offer exercises and games. Watch English movies with subtitles and listen to podcasts on topics that interest you, noting useful expressions. Join conversation groups to practice using new vocabulary in real communication. Remember that vocabulary acquisition is gradual—focus on words relevant to your needs and interests, and prioritize high-frequency words before specialized terminology."

    {
      "instruction": "How do I sound more natural and fluent in English conversations?",
      "response": "Sounding natural in English conversations involves several key practices. First, learn common phrases and expressions rather than focusing only on individual words—native speakers use chunks of language like 'as a matter of fact,' 'the thing is,' and 'to be honest' that make speech flow naturally. Master conversational connectors ('Well,' 'Actually,' 'You know,' 'I mean') that native speakers use to transition between ideas. Use contractions ('I'm' instead of 'I am') in casual speech, as overly precise pronunciation can sound unnatural. Learn fillers ('um,' 'uh,' 'like') and hesitation devices that give you thinking time—while not overusing them. Pay attention to intonation and sentence stress, as English is a stress-timed language where important words are emphasized. Practice reduced speech patterns that native speakers use, like 'gonna' for 'going to' or 'wanna' for 'want to' in informal contexts. Use appropriate body language, including gestures, facial expressions, and eye contact that match cultural expectations. Respond with backchanneling expressions ('Really?', 'I see', nodding) to show you're listening. Listen extensively to native speakers through podcasts, TV shows, and movies to internalize natural speech patterns. Record your own speech and compare it to native speech to identify areas for improvement. Finally, don't be afraid of making mistakes—fluency comes through practice, and hesitating too much to find 'perfect' expressions interrupts natural flow."

      "instruction": "How do I use relative clauses correctly?",
      "response": "Relative clauses add information about a noun by using relative pronouns (who, whom, whose, which, that) or adverbs (when, where, why). There are two main types: defining (restrictive) and non-defining (non-restrictive) relative clauses. Defining relative clauses provide essential information to identify the noun: 'The woman who called earlier wants to speak with you.' These clauses don't use commas and can use 'that' instead of 'who/which' ('The book that I bought'). Non-defining relative clauses provide extra, non-essential information and are separated by commas: 'My sister, who lives in Boston, is visiting next week.' These clauses don't use 'that'. Use 'who' for people ('The doctor who treated me'), 'which' for things ('The car which broke down'), 'that' for people or things in defining clauses only ('The movie that won'), 'whose' for possession ('The man whose car was stolen'), 'whom' in formal English as the object of a verb ('The candidate whom they selected'). When the relative pronoun is the object of the clause, it can be omitted in defining clauses: 'The movie (that) I watched' but not in non-defining clauses. Use 'where' for places ('The house where I grew up'), 'when' for times ('The day when we met'), and 'why' for reasons ('The reason why I called'). Prepositions can end relative clauses informally ('The person I spoke to') or precede the relative pronoun in formal contexts ('The person to whom I spoke')."

'Don't judge a book by its cover' warns against making judgments based on appearances. 'The early bird catches the worm' emphasizes the advantages of being prompt. 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do' advises adapting to local customs when visiting new places. 'Practice makes perfect' encourages persistence to achieve mastery. 'All that glitters is not gold' cautions that attractive appearances can be deceptive. 'Too many cooks spoil the broth' warns against too many people trying to control one project. 'A stitch in time saves nine' recommends addressing problems early before they worsen. 'Don't put all your eggs in one basket' advises against risking everything on a single venture. 'The pen is mightier than the sword' suggests that written words can have more impact than physical force. 'Necessity is the mother of invention' means difficult situations inspire creative solutions. 'You can't teach an old dog new tricks' suggests that established habits are hard to change. 'The grass is always greener on the other side' refers to the tendency to think others' situations are better than our own. 'Time is money' emphasizes that wasting time means losing opportunities.

      "instruction": "How do I write effective emails in English?",
      "response": "Effective English emails balance clarity, conciseness, and appropriate tone. First, consider your purpose and audience to determine formality level. For subject lines, be specific and concise ('Meeting Request: Budget Review' rather than 'Meeting'). Begin formal emails with 'Dear Mr./Ms./Dr. [Surname]' and less formal ones with 'Hello [Name]' or 'Hi [Name]' if you don't know the recipient's name. Open with a brief pleasantry ('I hope this email finds you well') and clearly state your purpose in the first paragraph. Organize content logically, using short paragraphs (3-5 lines) and bullet points for lists. Keep sentences concise and use simple language over complex terminology. Include all necessary information but eliminate redundant details. Be direct about action items, using phrases like 'Please review by Friday' rather than 'It would be great if you could possibly look at this when you have time'. Close formal emails with 'Yours sincerely,' 'Kind regards,' or 'Best regards,' and informal ones with 'Thanks,' 'Cheers,' or 'Best,' followed by your name and contact information as appropriate. For requests, use polite forms ('I would appreciate it if you could' rather than 'Send me'). For complaints, stay professional and solution-focused. Before sending, proofread for grammar, spelling, and tone. Check that attachments are included if mentioned. Remember that without facial expressions and tone of voice, written messages can be misinterpreted, so be extra careful with humor or sensitive topics."

      "instruction": "What are linking words and how do I use them correctly?",
      "response": "Linking words (also called connectors or transition words) show relationships between ideas, making your English writing and speaking more cohesive and logical. They fall into several categories based on function: 1) Addition: 'and,' 'furthermore,' 'moreover,' 'in addition,' 'besides,' 'what's more' (Example: 'The hotel was expensive. Furthermore, the service was poor.'). 2) Contrast: 'but,' 'however,' 'nevertheless,' 'on the other hand,' 'although,' 'despite,' 'in spite of' (Example: 'He studied hard. However, he failed the exam.'). 3) Cause and effect: 'because,' 'since,' 'as,' 'therefore,' 'consequently,' 'as a result,' 'thus' (Example: 'He didn't study. Therefore, he failed the test.'). 4) Sequence: 'firstly,' 'secondly,' 'next,' 'then,' 'finally,' 'meanwhile,' 'subsequently' (Example: 'First, preheat the oven. Then, mix the ingredients.'). 5) Examples: 'for example,' 'for instance,' 'such as,' 'particularly,' 'namely' (Example: 'Many countries, particularly those in Northern Europe, have excellent education systems.'). 6) Condition: 'if,' 'unless,' 'provided that,' 'as long as' (Example: 'We'll go to the beach if the weather is good.'). 7) Purpose: 'to,' 'in order to,' 'so that,' 'so as to' (Example: 'She studies hard in order to get good grades.'). Position these words correctly: many linking words like 'however,' 'therefore,' and 'consequently' can go at the beginning of a sentence followed by a comma, in the middle between commas, or after a semicolon. Avoid overusing the same linking words, and ensure you understand the precise meaning of each connector. In academic writing, use more formal linking words ('subsequently' instead of 'then'), while in conversation, simpler forms are often preferred."

      "response": "Phrasal verbs are combinations of words (a verb + a preposition, verb + an adverb, or verb + both) that when used together have a different meaning from the original verb. They are very common in everyday English but can be challenging for learners because their meanings are often not obvious from the individual words.\n\nHere are 5 common examples:\n\n1. Look up: to search for information (e.g., 'I need to look up this word in the dictionary.')\n\n2. Give up: to quit or surrender (e.g., 'Don't give up on your dreams.')\n\n3. Break down: to stop functioning; to analyze in detail; to lose emotional control (e.g., 'My car broke down on the highway.')\n\n4. Take off: to remove; to leave the ground (for planes); to leave quickly (e.g., 'The plane took off on time.')\n\n5. Come across: to find by chance; to create an impression (e.g., 'I came across an interesting article while researching.')"

      "instruction": "How do I use articles (a, an, the) correctly in English?",
      "response": "Using articles correctly in English follows these general rules:\n\n1. Use 'a' before singular nouns that begin with a consonant sound (a book, a university - 'university' starts with a 'y' sound).\n\n2. Use 'an' before singular nouns that begin with a vowel sound (an apple, an hour - 'hour' starts with a vowel sound).\n\n3. Use 'the' (definite article) when referring to something specific or already mentioned (the book you lent me, the United States).\n\n4. Use 'a/an' (indefinite articles) when introducing something for the first time, or when referring to any example of something (I saw a dog).\n\n5. Some nouns don't need articles, such as abstract nouns (love, happiness), uncountable nouns (water, information), and plural general nouns (Dogs are loyal animals).\n\n6. Names of countries, people, continents, cities, and streets usually don't need articles, but there are exceptions (the United Kingdom, the Sahara Desert).\n\nRemember that article usage can sometimes be idiomatic and may require memorization of specific phrases."

First Conditional: Used for real or possible situations in the future.\n   Structure: If + present simple, will/can/may + base verb\n   Example: If it rains tomorrow, I will take an umbrella.\n\n3. Second Conditional: Used for unreal or improbable situations in the present or future.\n   Structure: If + past simple, would/could/might + base verb\n   Example: If I won the lottery, I would travel around the world.\n\n4. Third Conditional: Used for impossible situations in the past (contrary to fact).\n   Structure: If + past perfect, would/could/might + have + past participle\n   Example: If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.\n\nMixed conditionals combine different types, usually second and third conditionals.\n   Example: If I had saved more money (past), I would be able to buy a car now (present).\n\nRemember that 'if' can often be replaced by other words like 'unless,' 'as long as,' 'provided that,' etc., which may slightly change the meaning."

      "instruction": "What are collocations in English and why are they important for language learners?",
      "response": "Collocations are combinations of words that naturally occur together in English and sound 'right' to native speakers. They are phrases where the words complement each other and are commonly used together.\n\nFor example:\n- 'Make a mistake' (not 'do a mistake')\n- 'Heavy rain' (not 'strong rain')\n- 'Take a photo' (not 'make a photo')\n- 'Strong coffee' (not 'powerful coffee')\n- 'Pay attention' (not 'give attention')\n\nCollocations are important for language learners for several reasons:\n\n1. Natural speech: Using correct collocations makes your English sound more natural and native-like.\n\n2. Precision: Collocations help express ideas more precisely and effectively.\n\n3. Fluency: Knowing common word combinations helps you speak and write more fluently without having to stop and think about word choices.\n\n4. Comprehension: Understanding collocations improves your listening and reading comprehension.\n\n5. Vocabulary expansion: Learning words in collocations (rather than in isolation) helps you remember vocabulary more effectively and use it appropriately.\n\n6. Avoiding errors: Many common mistakes in English come from directly translating collocations from one's native language.\n\nLearning collocations is best done through exposure to authentic language, noticing patterns, and conscious practice. Reading extensively, listening to native speakers, and using collocation dictionaries can all help develop this aspect of vocabulary knowledge."

      "instruction": "Explain the difference between formal and informal English with examples of each.",
      "response": "Formal and informal English represent different registers of language used in different contexts:\n\nFormal English:\n- Used in academic writing, business communications, speeches, and official documents\n- Characterized by complete sentences, proper grammar, more complex vocabulary, and avoiding contractions\n- Maintains professional distance and avoids personal language\n- Often uses passive voice and longer, more complex sentence structures\n\nExamples of formal English:\n- \"I would be grateful if you could respond at your earliest convenience.\"\n- \"The research indicates that the hypothesis is not supported by the evidence.\"\n- \"Please find attached the report requested on April 15th.\"\n- \"The company has implemented new procedures to enhance productivity.\"\n\nInformal English:\n- Used in everyday conversations, personal emails, social media, and casual settings\n- Characterized by contractions, colloquialisms, simpler vocabulary, and sometimes incomplete sentences\n- Often more direct and personal in tone\n- Uses active voice and shorter, simpler sentences\n\nExamples of informal English:\n- \"Can you get back to me ASAP?\"\n- \"That movie was amazing!\"\n- \"I'm gonna head out now. See you later!\"\n- \"The boss wants us to redo the whole thing. What a pain!\"\n\nContextual appropriateness is key. Using very informal language in a formal setting (like a job interview) can make you appear unprofessional, while using overly formal language in casual settings might make you seem stiff or pretentious.

      "response": "Reported speech (also called indirect speech) is used to report what someone else has said without quoting them exactly. Here's how to use it correctly:\n\n1. Basic structure: When converting direct speech to reported speech, we typically:\n   - Change the reporting verb (e.g., from \"says\" to \"said\")\n   - Adjust pronouns (e.g., \"I\" might become \"he\" or \"she\")\n   - Shift tenses backward in time (e.g., present becomes past)\n   - Adjust time expressions (e.g., \"today\" becomes \"that day\")\n   - Remove quotation marks\n\n2. Tense changes:\n   - Present simple → Past simple (\"I work\" → \"He said he worked\")\n   - Present continuous → Past continuous (\"I am studying\" → \"She said she was studying\")\n   - Present perfect → Past perfect (\"I have finished\" → \"He said he had finished\")\n   - Past simple → Past perfect (\"I went\" → \"She said she had gone\")\n   - Will → Would (\"I will help\" → \"He said he would help\")\n   - Can → Could (\"I can swim\" → \"She said she could swim\")\n   - Must → Had to (\"I must go\" → \"He said he had to go\")\n\n3. Time and place expression changes:\n   - Now → then\n   - Today → that day\n   - Yesterday → the day before\n   - Tomorrow → the next day/the following day\n   - This week → that week\n   - Here → there\n   - This → that\n\n4. Examples:\n   Direct: Tom said, \"I am going to the store now.\"\n   Reported: Tom said (that) he was going to the store then.\n\n   Direct: Sarah said, \"I will call you tomorrow.\"\n   Reported: Sarah said (that) she would call me the next day.\n\n   Direct: \"Have you finished your homework?\" the teacher asked.\n   Reported: The teacher asked if I had finished my homework.\n\n5. No tense change needed when reporting universal truths or facts that are still true:\n   Direct: The teacher said, \"The Earth revolves around the Sun.\"\n   Reported: The teacher said (that) the Earth revolves around the Sun.\n\n6. Reporting questions:\n   - Yes/No questions: use \"if\" or \"whether\"\n   - Wh-questions: keep the question word (what, when, where, etc.)\n   - Change word order from question to statement\n\nRemember that 'that' is optional after 'said' and similar reporting verbs in reported speech."

      "instruction": "How do I improve my English pronunciation?",
      "response": "Improving your English pronunciation requires consistent practice and attention to how sounds are produced. Here are effective strategies to enhance your pronunciation:\n\n1. Listen actively: Expose yourself to native speakers through movies, podcasts, songs, and audiobooks. Pay close attention to their rhythm, stress patterns, and intonation.\n\n2. Learn the phonetic alphabet: Understanding the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) can help you identify and produce specific sounds that might not exist in your native language.\n\n3. Record yourself: Compare your pronunciation with native speakers by recording yourself reading the same text. This helps identify specific areas needing improvement.\n\n4. Focus on word stress: English is a stress-timed language, meaning certain syllables receive more emphasis. Incorrect stress can make words difficult to understand, even if individual sounds are correct.\n\n5. Practice minimal pairs: Work with words that differ by just one sound (e.g., 'ship' vs. 'sheep', 'hat' vs. 'hit'). This trains your ear to distinguish between similar sounds.\n\n6. Pay attention to linking and reduction: Connected speech in English often features linked words and reduced vowels. Native speakers don't pronounce each word in isolation.\n\n7. Learn the rules of intonation: Question patterns, emphasis, and emotion are all conveyed through pitch variation in English.\n\n8. Use pronunciation apps and tools: Applications like Elsa Speak, Pronunciation Coach, or websites like Forvo can provide instant feedback.\n\n9. Shadow speech: Listen to short segments of speech and repeat them immediately, mimicking the speaker's pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation.\n\n10. Work with a language partner or tutor: Getting personalized feedback is invaluable for addressing your specific pronunciation challenges.\n\n11. Be patient: Pronunciation improvement takes time, especially for sounds that don't exist in your native language. Consistent practice is more important than quick results."
